        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Goat's Cheese Linguine with Herb Butter</h1>

        <p>This recipe is from The Vegetarian Student CookBook by Hamlyn. After a brief spell of eating either takeaway, or crappy pasta (Life is rather busy), I have a little gap in my chaos, and so I figured I'd open my cookbooks once again and find a few nice things to cook. The goat's cheese (atleast from Sainsbury's) is a little bit on the expensive side of things, but it does add quite a nice flavour. The recipe below isn't an exact duplicate of the one from the book, as I prefer a little more &#10024;flavour&#10024; in my food. </p>

        <h1>Ingredients: (serves 2)</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>150g goats cheese</p>

            </li>

                <p>160g Linguine </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Instructions:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Melt the butter with oil in a frying pan. Once heated, add the shallots and garlic and fry on a medium heat till golden brown.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, begin cooking the linguine according to the packet instructions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once golden brown, add the capers, herbs, lemon juice, salt and pepper and stir for 2 more minutes. Then take off the heat and set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Cut the goats cheese into slices of roughly 1.5cm each, and place under a grill till the top is browned. Then flip and brown the other side.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once the linguine is done, drain and add it to the frying pan along with the grilled goats cheese.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stir well to combine, and enjoy!</p>
            </li>
