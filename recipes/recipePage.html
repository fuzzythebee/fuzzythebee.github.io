        <p>Hi! Welcome to my recipes page. Here you will find a mix of recipes I have cooked and liked. These will wary between desserts, breads, mains, snacks and so on. At the moment I do not have any filter or sort buttons planned, but I might categorise them under headings here.</p>

        <p>My cooking philosophy is based on intuition. I don't believe in measuring out every single ingredient down to the perfect gram. Each person's palette is unique, and so by learning what it is you (and others you cook for) like, you give yourself the foundation to learn cooking in a way that feels personal, adaptable, and genuinely good. Hence, some ingredients may not have measurements, some may have a range, and some will be specific. Experiment, make mistakes, learn, but don't forget to have fun :)</p>

        <p>Find my recipes below:</p>
