            <p>Hi folks! My name is Adi. If you're here, it's because you probably already know me, so I will save you the spiel about what I do etc etc. And if you don't know me, then firstly I am surprised you've found this website, and secondly, exploring this website is the perfect way to get to know some bits about me!</p>

            <ul>

                    <p>If, for some strange reason, you want to peek into my mind, I write about things I find <a style="color: #e37814;" href="cool/coolPage.html">cool</a>.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Oh, and if life isn't beating the crap out of me, I cook. Here are some of my <a style="color: #e37814;" href="recipes/recipePage.html">recipes</a>.</p>
